            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> My name is Jurian Sapoetra and I'm 38 years old.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            While working in the field of marketing and communication for some time, I built several websites and webshops using the UI of WordPress. Through the years my interest in front-end development started growing and this year I finally decided to take action. Currently I am following an intensive front-end development course at Winc Academy and I am enjoying it very much.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            The curriculum is focused on JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS, Jest & Redux, working in an Agile Scrum environment and more. After I finish this course I plan to search for a nice job as a front-end developer and learn to work with other frame-works and programming languages such as Python, Angular, Vue and TypeScipt.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            I am very enthusiastic about the new skill set that I am developing now and looking forward to start a new career as a developer.
